Development Manual
=======

Source control client used is GitHub. Github was chosen both because it's the source control client the course focused on, as well as the fact that some of us already had experience with it.

Source control can be accessed through its clone url. However we did decide on forking being the best thing to do, as it would allow us to work independantly before merging. So you should probably click fork near the top right corner and work independantly, when you want to merge do a pull request.
