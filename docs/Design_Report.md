Vision
-----------

This project inolves the team coding a simple java game of Tic Tac Toe. However the main goal of this is actually to help the team come to grips with modern coding work methods. These methods include such things as: Push/Pull source control, enough documentation and appropriate testing.

Success Criteria
-----------

These criteria are:

* A functional program that can be used to play Tic Tac Toe.
* The program must be deployable as some kind of executable file.
* The program should have a GUI, needs not be a complex one but it should be there.
* The project should have documentation that explains how to work on this project, the vision statement and how to run the program.
* The Program should ideally be designed in a loosely coupled manner and be tested frequently
